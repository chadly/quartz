Consciousness is the fire that breathes life into the equations and laws of physics. It is the intrinsic nature of matter.

[[Science Explains How, Not What|Since science ignores the intrinsic nature of matter]], in order to fully realize a *Grand Unified Theory of Everything*, we need to move beyond science.

**Panpsychism** offers a solution in that it solves two problems:

1. Science explicitly has no place for consciousness.
2. There is a huge hole at the center of our scientific story of the universe: no explanation for the *intrinsic nature* of matter.

Panpsychism plugs the hole with consciousness.

The mathematical models of science don't tell us anything about the intrinsic nature of reality but at the same time don't exclude them.

If science tells us that an electron has a mass and a charge and how those properties influence its behavior as it interacts with other electrons, panpsychism tells us the *nature* of those forces: **elemental forms of consciousness**.

This is discreet from the dualistic view that consciousness exists outside of the realm of physicality acting upon it. Instead, it describes consciousness as the fundamental nature of these forces. Consciousness is not another property associated with the electron. Instead, it is the electron. The mass and charge and other properties are forms and expressions of this consciousness.

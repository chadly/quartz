Consciousness isn't a sophisticated capability that emerges *after* learning, but rather a fundamental prerequisite for learning itself. This insight emerges from a simple but powerful observation: no human has ever achieved significant cognitive development without first being conscious.

Before a baby can master even basic tasks like tracking a moving finger, they must already possess consciousness. This suggests that consciousness isn't a complex achievement that comes after mastering perception and motor skills, but rather the very mechanism that enables such learning to occur.

This perspective reframes consciousness as a [[Consciousness as a Coherence Engine|basic training algorithm for self-organizing systems]]. Rather than being more complex than perception, consciousness may actually be simpler â€” it's the foundation that makes sophisticated perception possible.

Without consciousness, human development stalls completely.

This suggests that consciousness might be surprisingly simple in its basic form, since it must emerge early in development, while still being fundamental to all higher cognitive capabilities.

[[AI Development Is An Evolution of Traditional Software Development|Programming AI models]] is akin to [[Calculus is an Evolution of Mathematics|developing calculus over traditional mathematics]].

Just as calculus handles continuous, infinite sets and fuzzy boundaries, AI development manages *ambiguous* inputs and outputs.

Traditional software translates *explicit human logic* into binary code, producing deterministic results.

In contrast, AI development transforms vast, unstructured data through **probabilistic methods**. The process involves preparing, featurizing, training, and evaluating data, resulting in a model that can generate varied, probabilistic outputs.

This paradigm shift allows AI to handle **open-ended tasks**, producing different results each time, much like how calculus addresses the complexities of continuous change beyond traditional mathematics' scope.

Science is not equipped to explain the *Hard Problem of Consciousness* at a fundamental level because science only exists because it took subjective experience outside of its purview.

At the time of Galileo, the naturalistic philosophy of Aristotle dominated thought. These ideas worked with qualities rather than quantities.

It was Galileo who said that there is a "book to the universe" and if we hope to see in the dark labyrinth we find ourselves in, we need to learn to speak its language: mathematics.

In order to do this, Galileo discarded the qualities of subjective experience such as the smells and colors we experience as machinations of the soul while in the material world, objects only had:

- Size
- Shape
- Location
- Motion

This mind-body separation - this naturalistic dualism - is hardwired into us with children at an early age categorizing "mental things" as distinct from "physical things."

Science has been so successful at describing the natural world *precisely because* it limits its scope.

Calculus represents a fundamental evolution in mathematics, extending its reach beyond static quantities to **dynamic processes**.

By introducing concepts like **limits**, **derivatives**, and **integrals**, calculus enables the study of **continuous change and motion**.

It allows mathematicians to model and analyze systems that **evolve over time**, from the trajectory of a planet to the growth of populations.

Calculus provides tools to quantify rates of change and the accumulation of quantities, bridging gaps left by algebra and geometry. This evolution transforms mathematics into a more powerful and versatile discipline, capable of addressing complex, real-world phenomena with precision and depth.

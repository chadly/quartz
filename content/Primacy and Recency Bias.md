Our minds our plagued by primacy and recency biases when reading. We tend to remember things from the beginning of a reading session (primacy) and toward the end of a reading session (recency).

This means that if we want to remember more of what we read, we should train ourselves to read in chunks using techniques such as Pomodoro.

This technique breaks up our reading sessions with frequent breaks - typically 20 minutes focusing with a 5 minute break. This gives our mind much more sessions in which we are able to harness the power of our mind working with it instead of against it.

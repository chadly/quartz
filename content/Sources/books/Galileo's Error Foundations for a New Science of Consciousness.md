Galileo's Error: Foundations for a New Science of Consciousness
By [[people/Philip Goff]]

The book discusses the challenges physical science faces in explaining consciousness. It explores the idea that science can reveal new ways of understanding the world and consciousness. The author argues for panpsychism as the most probable hypothesis for understanding the intrinsic nature of the universe.

> And this is because our scientific knowledge of the world is itself mediated through conscious experience. We are able to perform observations and experiments only because we have conscious experience of the world around us.

the objectivity of science depends on the subjectivity of conscious experience.

> If Galileo traveled in time to the present day to hear that we are having difficulty giving a physical explanation of consciousness, he would most likely respond, “Of course you are, I designed physical science to deal with *quantities* not *qualities*!”

> It turns out that, although the cerebellum has more neurons, its neurons are much less connected than those of the cerebrum. As a result, there is a lot more integrated information in the cerebrum than in the cerebellum, which is exactly what IIT predicts is important for consciousness.

> In the specific case of IIT, it is proposed that consciousness is correlated with integrated information: wherever you have integrated information you have consciousness and vice versa. But IIT does nothing to explain why that correlation holds.

> But if quantum dualism is true, the immaterial mind plays a role complementary to, rather than at odds with, physics. On the face of it, physics suggests that something in the vicinity of observation changes superpositions into definite values. The quantum dualist merely adopts this role for the conscious mind.

> In other words, I have but one small window onto the intrinsic nature of matter: I know that the intrinsic nature of the matter inside my brain involves consciousness. I know this because I am directly aware of the reality of my own consciousness. And, assuming dualism is false, this reality I am directly aware of is at least part of the intrinsic nature of my brain.

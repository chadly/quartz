Galileo's Error: Foundations for a New Science of Consciousness
By [[people/Philip Goff]]

The book discusses the challenges physical science faces in explaining consciousness. It explores the idea that science can reveal new ways of understanding the world and consciousness. The author argues for panpsychism as the most probable hypothesis for understanding the intrinsic nature of the universe.

### Highlights
> The Post-Galilean Manifesto
> • *Realism About Consciousness:* The reality of subjective consciousness is a basic datum in its own right, equal in status to the data of observation and experiment.
> • *Empiricism:* The quantitative data of observation and experiment are foundational, equal in status to the qualitative data of consciousness.
> • *Anti-Dualism:* Consciousness is not separate from the physical world; rather consciousness is located in the intrinsic nature of the physical world.
> • *Panpsychist Methodology:* We should aim to account for human and animal consciousness in terms of more basic forms of consciousness, basic forms of consciousness which are postulated to exist as basic properties of matter.[*13](#_footnote_d1-00009932)
> Within this unified research program there are two camps: reductionists and emergentists. Their immediate goals are as follows:
> • *Reductionist panpsychists*—To solve the combination problem, by giving a general account of how complex forms of consciousness can be built up from simpler forms of consciousness.
> • *Emergentist panpsychists*—To formulate and test theories of the basic principles of nature underlying the emergence of higher-level forms of consciousness from more basic forms of consciousness.

> And this is because our scientific knowledge of the world is itself mediated through conscious experience. We are able to perform observations and experiments only because we have conscious experience of the world around us.

the objectivity of science depends on the subjectivity of conscious experience.

> If Galileo traveled in time to the present day to hear that we are having difficulty giving a physical explanation of consciousness, he would most likely respond, “Of course you are, I designed physical science to deal with *quantities* not *qualities*!”

> It turns out that, although the cerebellum has more neurons, its neurons are much less connected than those of the cerebrum. As a result, there is a lot more integrated information in the cerebrum than in the cerebellum, which is exactly what IIT predicts is important for consciousness.

> But if quantum dualism is true, the immaterial mind plays a role complementary to, rather than at odds with, physics. On the face of it, physics suggests that something in the vicinity of observation changes superpositions into definite values. The quantum dualist merely adopts this role for the conscious mind.

> the main motivation for embracing materialism arises from an incorrect view of the history of science. It is thought that the great and rightly celebrated success of physical science gives us overwhelming reason to embrace materialism as the true theory of consciousness (as well as everything else). In fact, physical sciences have been so successful precisely because from Galileo onward they set aside the *qualitative* in order to focus on the *quantitative.* The fact that physical science has done well when it ignores consciousness gives us no reason to think it will do well when it tries to apply its quantitative methods to consciousness itself.

> In other words, I have but one small window onto the intrinsic nature of matter: I know that the intrinsic nature of the matter inside my brain involves consciousness. I know this because I am directly aware of the reality of my own consciousness. And, assuming dualism is false, this reality I am directly aware of is at least part of the intrinsic nature of my brain.

> If IIT is to be believed, then we should perhaps be wary of the growth of social connectivity. This is because IIT predicts that if the growth of internet-based connectivity ever resulted in the amount of integrated information in society surpassing the amount of integrated information in a human brain, then not only would society become conscious but human brains would be “absorbed” into that higher form of consciousness. Brains would cease to be conscious in their own right and would instead become mere cogs in the mega-conscious entity that is the society including its internet-based connectivity.

[Galileo's Error: Foundations for a New Science of Consciousness]()
By [[people/Philip Goff]]

The book discusses the challenges physical science faces in explaining consciousness. It explores the idea that science can reveal new ways of understanding the world and consciousness. The author argues for panpsychism as the most probable hypothesis for understanding the intrinsic nature of the universe.

### Highlights
> And this is because our scientific knowledge of the world is itself mediated through conscious experience. We are able to perform observations and experiments only because we have conscious experience of the world around us.

the objectivity of science depends on the subjectivity of conscious experience.

> If Galileo traveled in time to the present day to hear that we are having difficulty giving a physical explanation of consciousness, he would most likely respond, “Of course you are, I designed physical science to deal with *quantities* not *qualities*!”

> Whereas Galileo set the soul outside of the domain of natural science, the naturalistic dualist wants to expand science in such a way as to include nonphysical minds.

> Radical materialists argue that consciousness is an illusion. More moderate materialists hope that we will one day be able to explain the subjective inner world of consciousness in terms of the chemistry of the brain.

> The psychologist Paul Bloom has argued that dualist thought is hardwired into us and that from an early age children start to categorize “mental things” as distinct from “physical things.”

> When it comes to the basic causal workings of the universe, scientists provide mathematical laws which describe with great accuracy *how* matter behaves, but they provide no explanation of *why* matter behaves in that way.

> It turns out that, although the cerebellum has more neurons, its neurons are much less connected than those of the cerebrum. As a result, there is a lot more integrated information in the cerebrum than in the cerebellum, which is exactly what IIT predicts is important for consciousness.

> In the specific case of IIT, it is proposed that consciousness is correlated with integrated information: wherever you have integrated information you have consciousness and vice versa. But IIT does nothing to explain why that correlation holds.

> If a naturalistic dualist were persuaded of the truth of IIT, then her view would be that there is a fundamental psycho-physical law of nature—as fundamental as the law of gravity—that wherever you have integrated information you have consciousness.

> But if quantum dualism is true, the immaterial mind plays a role complementary to, rather than at odds with, physics. On the face of it, physics suggests that something in the vicinity of observation changes superpositions into definite values. The quantum dualist merely adopts this role for the conscious mind.
